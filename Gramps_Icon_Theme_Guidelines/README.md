# Gramp Icon Theme Guidelines


## Introduction
The Gramps icon theme's goal is to create a distinctive theme guide for Gramps icons. A user running a multiplatform application should not have the impression that the look is unpolished and incosistent with what he or she is used to. While this isn't about merging styles of all desktop systems, we do aim to not be drastically different on each platform.

Along with a generic type fallback, having a similar style will help in the transition phase with some legacy icons which may still remain on a user's particular desktop.

## Color Palette

Having a common color palette is required to have a consistant look across all icons. Visual style is heavily influenced by the colors used.

The Gramps color palette consists of 27 RGB colors, based on the Tango palette, as shown on the image above. Most desktops allow for 24-bit RGB icons (+8-bit Alpha channel).

The common practice when drawing icons is to use the palette as a base, applying it on large areas. Shading with gradients, creating highlight and shadows by changing value, and minor changes of saturation are also allowed and endorsed. Colors do not have to come exclusively from this set, as additional colors may be used. Starting from the base color and changing value, saturation or even hue slightly gives more consistant results that starting from arbitrary colors.

***Note the latest development version of GIMP and Inkscape ship the Tango palette by default***.
